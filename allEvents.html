							<h1>Independence day <span style="color:#F1633B">Orphanage visit</span></h1>
							<p>2022</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>In the spirit of India's 75th Independence Day, we at NSS BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus visited various orphanages across India to give children the love they deserve. In turn, they gave us moments to cherish. The memories of visiting Prerna and Cheers foundation orphanage are some of those that would hold dear to us for a long time.

								The event began with hoisting the flag where the volunteers, the kids, caregivers and founders of the orphanage came together to celebrate their patriotism towards the mother nation.
								
								We have conducted events ranging from housie to musical chairs. Later in the day, when we played songs, the kids started to dance along to the tunes of the songs. We also provided the kids with some gifts, where the children also looked content and their happiness was indeed encouraging and fulfilling for us. The enthusiasm and the joy in the kids’ eyes and the love they had for us filled our hearts with utmost delight.
								
								We'd like to express our gratitude to all the contributors who made the event engaging and successful.
								</p>

							<h1>Cleanliness <span style="color:#F1633B">Drive</span></h1>
							<p>2022</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>Cleanliness is our own responsibility. It is as essential as we need food, water and clothes to live. Absence of cleanliness leads to various types of diseases, illness and breeding places for flies, mosquitoes etc and therefore, cleanliness and health are related to each other. So, on the NSS day, the proud Bitsians took on the initiative of making the campus clean and thus, a successful cleanliness drive was organised by NSS on 24th September 2022. Many volunteers actively participated in the drive where they started collecting trash and garbage scattered from various places and ultimately dumping them in the dustbins where they were originally meant to be in and thereby motivating other students not to throw their wastes on campus grounds. We are always keen to conduct such drives in future and looking forward to your active participation.</p>

							<p>On the 30th of September, we at NSS BPHC hosted SPIC MACAY (Society for Promotion of Indian Classical Music And Culture Amongst Youth). We had Shri Dhananjay Hedge with his team singing two fantabulous Hindustani songs. After the delightful performance, the audience interacted with Shri Dhananjay Hegde. The evening was filled with soothing music and intellectual dialogue. Once again we thank Shri Dhananjay Hegde and his team for making the evening beautiful. We also thank the volunteers for making this event a success.</p>

							<p>Survey conducted on campus asking students if any have faced bias with respect to gender in any domain - be it projects, placements, or in any clubs or departments. Inputs were taken from the students on measures that could be implemented so as to reduce the extent of such discrimination on campus. A discussion with the higher authorities took place and an informal group was formed consisting of students so as to reduce the gap in between the administration and students who had concerns.

							<p>Recently, NSS BPHC visited ZPHS High School Thumkunta for a Diya decoration competition. There was a total of 160 kids studying from 6th to 8th standard. We commenced the event with mesmerizing dance and music performances by the kids. Later the students were made aware of the harmful effects of Firecrackers and why to abstain from them, along with Diya Decoration to make them aware of the eco-friendly ways of celebrating Diwali, keeping the fun intact in the festival of Lights. Finally, diyas were lit up and placed near the idol of Saraswati Matha (Goddess), and this marked the end of our event at Thumkunta High School.</p>

							<h1>NSS Far From <span style="color:#F1633B">Home</span></h1>
							<p>2021</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>Our first event under this project was aimed at spreading environmental mindfulness and COVID awareness.
We have successfully distributed pamphlets and 100 ml sanitizers to 400 households in the villages of Menakur and Chavali in Nellore district. These oil printed pamphlets in the village’s native language were an effective and captivating method of  conveying our message. They contained interactive text and images about dealing with COVID in several situations and also its impact on their environment.
Although it was an end in itself, the experience of this interaction enriched our being!
NSS believes in helping the community however we can, and encourages each and every one of you to do the same. If you have been up to any community service, we’d love to hear all about it and share your inspiring acts of kindness.
“Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.”

Distributed 200 pamphlets to Government School Children in Guntur District. We also explained to them the importance of the Environment and precautions to reduce Environmental Pollution.
The schools being -
1. Zilla Parishad Unnatha Paatashala - Prathipadu, Guntur Dist.
2. Kolla Subbaiah Raghavamma Zilla Parishad Unnatha Paatashala - Annaparru, Guntur Dist.
NSS believes in helping the community; however, we can and encourages everyone to do so.

							<h1>In Sync With <span style="color:#F1633B">The World</span></h1>
							<p>2021</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>Most of us don’t understand the art of gaining info about the events occurring around us. We often miss some of the significant events that occurred, given the only popular stuff represented in social media.
Hence we started releasing major news events that took place in a month and post them on our Facebook, and Instagram handles. Our main aim being, news reaches made easier for everyone, enabling them to examine/think/contemplate/know about important events at the end of every month.
The news articles are divided into National and International, which won’t require any further explanation. These articles will also act as a pool of resources for people giving the exams for civil services. There will also be a drive folder with all the articles in a systematic order.

							<h1>Nukkad <span style="color:#F1633B">Naatak</span></h1>
							<p>2020</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>At some point or the other, we’ve all experienced half-eaten food packages littered near our food courts. A mix of disgust and disbelief awaited us when we realized that the ones responsible were our peers. To preserve the beauty of the campus isn’t the only reason why we should clean up after ourselves. Cleanliness is fundamental to anyone in society. 

To address this issue in a creative manner, NSS teamed up with the Dramatics Club. The duo organized Nukkad Natak to tactfully send a message to the masses. This one of a kind street play was instrumental in sensitizing BPHC to the excessive littering that takes place.
Kudos to the Dramatics club for putting up an amazing show!

Both the elderly and the young were a part of these visits, which included fun and inspiring activities with the kids as well as gentle talks with the elderly.

							<h1>Educational <span style="color:#F1633B">Out Reach</span></h1>
							<p>2020</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>NSS conducted some continuous events, one of which is “Educational Outreach Program”. This program is aimed to make education more relevant to the present situation, to meet the current needs of the community, inculcating good values in the young and bright minds of our society and supplement the education of the university/college students by bringing them face to face with the rural situations.
“When your mind is like a bucket, knowledge is like those drops of water that you fill in it.” 
This program commenced with Visit to ZPHS Thumkunta for conducting 'Logical Reasoning' classes for the high school students that aimed to improve the Aptitude skills and Critical thinking of students. The volunteers indeed proved that “A man without education is like a building without foundation!” An event “Aptitude and Reasoning test” was conducted that aimed to test the IQ of children, and career guidance was given accordingly. Some other events included Awareness sessions about Moral etiquettes, correct posture and basic manners which mainly focussed on how greed can influence to do bad things and importance of being loving, caring, kind and compassionate towards living beings around us and to inculcate good habits, importance of Value Education and how it can help students to become sensible and responsible citizens. The students have shown great enthusiasm and active participation throughout the events. The main idea behind this event is “People come and go, but it is only “Knowledge” that remains beyond death.!”

							<br><br>
							<p>Women mostly of rural areas, being talented have very limited ways of applying them, and are not self-employed. What did we do?We examined the skills and experience of the women at Anthaipally village, which is one of the nearby villages of our campus. We have looked into the feasibility of teaching new skills to them and the generation of market for one-time handicrafts was also analysed. 
Process of making paper bags was shown, so as to directly use them in our campus’ eateries and other shops, indirectly reducing the flow of plastic, also creating employment opportunities for them.

							<h1>Tree <span style="color:#F1633B">Adoption</span></h1>
							<p>2019</p>
							<br><br>
							<p>We sensed the importance of planting trees and saplings and thus came out with the concept, the ‘Tree Plantation program.’ With the exuberance of our volunteers, we could directly get into our work.
Our work started off with the boost that we got under the Haritha Haram programme of the State government. We borrowed about 87 saplings and distributed them in the nearby villages of Anthaipally, Thimmaipally and Thumkunta. We interacted with the villagers and addressed the problem of the declining green cover. We can say that we did make an impact in the villages as people understood the importance of trees and planted the saplings in their houses. This event is always special to us as it witnessed one of our largest volunteer turnouts and thus eventually had a great reach to the people.
The opportunity to write such beautiful lines about our organization is made possible only with the help of our highly energetic volunteers. With a lot of support and assistance to come, we are confident of taking ourselves to the place that we envision.

							<h1>Health <span style="color:#F1633B">Camp</span></h1>
							<p>2018</p>

							<p>Most people don't feel the need to check up on their health once in a while.
To encounter the above problems, at least on a local level, we have arranged a health camp in the Thumukunta Z.P.H.S.. People from the nearby villages came and had themselves tested for abnormal blood sugar levels, blood pressure levels, ECG and so on. We also provided transportation facility for near by village Antahipally for those who interested in health check up.
Organising this health camp proved to be very beneficial for the people of Anthaipally as it was found that there is no primary health centre in their village.
People were given suitable suggestions about daily practices and medicines,if found to have some abnormalities.

							<p>We know how crucial physical fitness is in one's life. Sports is one among that which ensures this. They play a vital part in a student'sin student's growth and development. They help in the development of both mental health and physical fitness of the body. Through participation in sports and games, a student gains various skills, experience, and confidence which helps to develop their personality. Games also encourage us to build a strong bond of friendship.
As a part of this, NSS BPHC had visited Thumkunta High School, where our volunteers conducted Sports Day and an awareness session on the importance of Republic Day and general awareness on Indian heritage and got the josh of children high on nationalism! Volunteers along with children had a wonderful day playing kabaddi, kho-kho, 3-legged race, balloon race, and many more followed by prize distribution.
